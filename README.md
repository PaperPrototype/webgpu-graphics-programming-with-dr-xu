# Welcome!

This series of youtube tutorials are by Dr Xu and were posted to [his Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/PracticalProgrammingwithDrXu). All credit to him. I took it upon myself to take the tutorial videos and organize them into a course in sparker :)

This course and all its markdown files are free and open source! If you find a mistake or want to suggest an edit you can make a pull request or open an issue!
